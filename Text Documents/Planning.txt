Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning Project

General Rules of Tic Tac Toe will apply.

Neural Network:
27 inputs (9 possible moves * 3 possible states (empty, X, and O))
9 outputs (9 possible moves)
I will not be having any hidden layers for this project, but I do intend to do so for the next one

When first generating the network, each neuron weight will be randomly generated from -1 to 1
